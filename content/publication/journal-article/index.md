abstract: It is well-known that the human visual system is adapted to the statistical structure of natural scenes. Yet there are important classes of images – for example, medical images – that are not natural scenes, and therefore, that are expected to have statistical properties that deviate from the class of images that shaped the evolution and development of human vision. Here, focusing on structural brain MRI images, we quantify and characterize these deviations in terms of a set of local image statistics to which human visual sensitivity has been well-characterized, and that has previously been used for natural image analysis. Analysis of local image statistics was then carried out on whitened images. For all of the databases as well as for the simulated images, we found that the three-point correlations contributed substantially to the differences between the “texture” of randomly selected ROIs. The informative nature of three-point correlations for brain MRI was greater than for natural images, and also disproportionate to human visual sensitivity. As this finding was consistent across databases, it is likely to result from brain geometry at the scale of brain MRI resolution, rather than characteristics of specific imaging and reconstruction methods.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Development of image processing systems and algorithms is often guided by the strategies used by the human visual system. A main motivation for this approach is that drawing inferences from images is a complex and ill-posed problem, but one that the human visual system, as a result of evolutionary and developmental forces, has become reasonably effective at solving.
